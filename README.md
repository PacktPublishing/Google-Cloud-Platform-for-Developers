With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

### Software and Hardware List

All examples and exercises in this book can be completed directly within the Google Cloud Console and Google Cloud Shell, however many users will prefer to work within a local development environment. To do so, download and install the Google Cloud SDK available
at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/. 

Just a current browser, a GCP account, and optionally a GitHub account. There's a note about using
Jetbrains IntelliJ for debugging but the same example is provided using the Google Cloud Console.

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/GoogleCloudPlatformforDevelopers_ColorImages.pdf).
