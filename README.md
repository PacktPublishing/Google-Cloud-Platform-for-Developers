**Build highly scalable cloud solutions with the power of Google Cloud Platform**

## What is this book about?
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides autoscaling compute power and distributed in-memory cache, task queues, and datastores to write, build, and deploy Cloud-hosted applications.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the various service offerings on GCP
* Deploy and run services on managed platforms such as App Engine and Container Engine
* Securely maintain application states with Cloud Storage, Datastore, and Bigtable
* Leverage StackDriver monitoring and debugging to minimize downtime and mitigate issues without impacting users
* Design and implement complex software solutions utilizing Google Cloud
